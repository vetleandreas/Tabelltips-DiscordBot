# Tabelltips-DiscordBot
 
This Discord bot written in Python registers users' guesses for league tables in sports. Preferably to be used before a season begins. 

The teams.json file is replaceable with any team you wish, with this one in particular being based on the Norwegian football league. It saves the guesses in submits.json.
Remember to fill out your .env file with the appropriate tokens, ID's and such. 

The BotScript.py file is the official bot, with devbot being a testing subject and the last one being just a modification of the standard one, with it being used right at the end of a season separately - just for crazy guesses.
